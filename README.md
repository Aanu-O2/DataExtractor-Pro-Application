# üìÇ  Data-Extractor-Application 
This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate how to develop a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of converting PDF or PNG files into structured JSON payloads using advanced machine learning vision technologies (an API integration with OpenAI's GPT-V).

## üíª  Technologies Used
- `Python`
- `AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)`
- `MongoDB`
- `OpenAI API (GPT-4 Vision)`
- `Streamlit`
- `Boto3`
- `Base64`

## üåü  Features
Here's what you can do with DataExtractorPro:

**Upload Your Files:** Easily upload PDF or PNG files. Just drag and drop your documents into the application, and let DataExtractorPro handle the rest.

**Automatic Data Extraction:** Once you upload a file, our ML vision technology kicks in, analyzing your document and extracting structured data. Whether it's text from a PNG or data points from a PDF, we've got it covered.

**Review and Confirm:** After extraction, you'll see a neatly organized preview of the extracted data. If something doesn't look right, you can directly edit the information on-screen. Confirm when you're satisfied to proceed.

**Data Structuring:** Your confirmed data is automatically structured into a JSON payload, ready for any API or database. You see exactly how your data is organized and can make last-minute tweaks if needed.

**Save and Store:** With a click, your original file and the structured JSON payload are securely saved in our database. Perfect for building a rich dataset for ML training purposes.

**Zoom & Edit for Precision:** Zoom in to review details or zoom out for a broader view. Essential for those intricate data points you don't want to miss.

**Pan Through Your Upload History:** Navigate through your past uploads and extracted data with ease. It's like having an infinite canvas of your work, ready for review or further editing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è   The Process
**Development Phases:**

‚Ä¢ Backend Development: I focused on creating a scalable and efficient backend structure that could handle .pdf and .png file uploads, convert PDFs to images, and interact with ML models for data extraction.

‚Ä¢ Integration of ML Models: Integrating the ML models was a pivotal phase. I experimented with different models and APIs to find the most accurate and efficient solution for our data extraction needs.

‚Ä¢ Frontend Development with Streamlit: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface with Streamlit was crucial. I aimed for simplicity, enabling users to easily upload files, view extracted data, and make corrections if necessary.

‚Ä¢ Database Integration: The final step involved setting up database connections to store the images and JSON payloads securely, focusing on future scalability and data retrieval for ML training sets.

## üìö  What I Learned
‚Ä¢ Continuous Learning: This project was a testament to the ever-evolving nature of technology and the need for continuous learning and adaptation as a developer.
